Are you ready for some CHANGE!? And by that I mean maybe some code that actually does something and stays in production and junk?
This is gonna be in web.py...oh yes it is!

This is a simple site showcasing my personal projects and interests. Maybe one day I'll have time for a blog and that will be included here. For now, it's simple and straight forward...expect fantastical glitter ponies and puppy rainbows later.
